# Placeholders

Placeholders are things wrapped with \{\} that tells the game to fill them in.
I haven't found all of them yet but these are the ones I have.

## Cards Placeholders

| Placeholder | Info |
|--|--|
|\{desc\}| The separator from the card title and description. Anything before this is considered the title and anything after the description. |
|\{dmg\}| Autofills the damage number of the card. |
