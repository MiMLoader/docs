# Installing MiMLoader

## Getting Started

Get started by **downloading the *[mimloader executable](https://github.com/MiMLoader/MiMLoader/releases)***.

## Launching the modded version of the game

Open the official moonstone island page on steam click the cog -> Manage -> Browse local files.

This will open the vanilla games file, we don't want to modify these so go one folder above. This should be where all your steam games are.
Now make a new folder called `MiMLoader` and put the executable you just downloaded in there.

Now we can add this to steam as a custom game.
In the lower left corner of steam click Add a Game -> Add a Non-Steam game, then select your mimloader executable.

Now you can launch the mod loader from steam!
